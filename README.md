# mps-examples

This repository contains example files for Music Processing Suite.
Each example contains the following music representations:

* Language representation of the composition in MC2L (Musical Context Composition Language)
* Visual representation of the composition context tree model as `.dot` and `.pdf` file
* Time-based representation of the composition in the form of an `.svg` file containing the so called context stream model
* Resulting score of the composition model generated using LilyPond
* A MIDI file to play back the piece

Music Processing Suite is the doctoral thesis project of David Hofmann <dev@davehofmann.de>.
